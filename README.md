Installation
============

You need to clone the repo at this [link](https://github.com/QuentinDstl/p_scarp) or download the zip file.

__You may need to change manually some stuff in some of the following files:__

.config file
------------

| what is in `.config` |||
|---|---|---|
| `[SAVING] SAVE_DATA_PATH` | _C:/Folder/To/Save/the_result.csv_ | 💾 where to save the current website |

> ⚠️ If `.config` doesn't exist, it will be created on next launch and you will be asked to choose it.


.env file
---------

| what is in `.env` |||
|---|---|---|
| `DIR_CHROMEAPP_PATH` | _C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/_ | 📁 used to launch Chrome on debugging mode |
| `PORT` | _9222_ | 🔌port used to launch the new chrome window |

> ⚠️ The `PORT` must __not be used by another app__. Launch `cmd` with admin rights and execute : `netstat -a` to see what port are used.

> 📖 To get the `DIR_CHROMEAPP_PATH` :
> ```
> 1. Window + S: to start a research
> 2. Now search for `Chrome`
> 3. Righ-click on the logo that just pops
> 4. Click on: Open File Location
> 5. In the new window, right-click on `Google Chrome` shortcut file
> 6. Click on: Open File Location
> 7. Copy, paste the path of the newly opened folder into the `.env` file
> ```
> The __path should look like__ that : `C:/Files/Chrome/Application/`.

Features
========
Templates
---------

Templates are used to know what information to scrape on what website. 
 You can find in `example.json` an example of a set of pages and rules.
 
 A template has 2 important parts:
  1. The Template Specific Name
  2. The Template List of Pages
     - a. The page guideline
     - b. The page rules
     - c. The page basic rule (_optional_)

<br>

### ___1. Template Specific Name___

The __name__ of the template file : `name.json` is important as it will be the string used to load it.

> 📖 For example, if you want to scrap data on the website `https://www.scrap-me.com`, you will need to create a `scrap-me.json` template file.

<br>

### ___2. The Template List of pages___

A website can have many different pages. For example `https://www.scrap-me.com` can have the following pages :
- `https://www.scrap-me.com/profiles`
- `https://www.scrap-me.com/companies`

We can create different scrapping rules for each one of them or create a basic rule that will apply to every page.

You will find in the template a `"pages"` array that contains all the individual page in some `{}` and separate by `,`.

<br>

### ___a. The page guideline___

Each page has the following two information :

| variable | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `fileName` | _string_ | the default __name of the file__ that will be saved for this page of the website website |
| `urlSelector` | _string_ | the __string__ in the url __that will differentiate this page__ from the others for the same website |

> 📖 For example, in the case of the page with the url :
> 
> `https://www.scrap-me.com/companies` , we can do :
> ```json
> "fileName": "ScrapMe_Companies",
> "urlSelector": "/companies",
> ```

<br>

### ___b. The page rules___

The rules are defined in the `"rules"` array of rule.

A rule allows you to define how you will select one data information that you want to save and under what form and what name you will save it.

> 📖 You can add as many rules as you want to save information on the web page.

A rule has the following information :

| variable | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `htmlTag` | _string_ | a [html tag](#html-tags) that the selenium will search for |
| `value` | _string_ | the value of the data that the html tag has |
| `saveAs` | _string_ | the name of the column for this information in the CSV |
| `saveType` | _string_ | the [saving type](#saving-types) that will define the data format |


> 📖 For example, in the case of the following html tag :
> ```html
> <p class="company-title"> Super Company Name </p>
> ```
> We can create the following rule :
> ```json
>    {
>        "htmlTag": "class",
>        "value": "company-title",
>        "saveAs": "Company Name",
>        "saveType": "string"
>    }
> ```

> 📖 In the case of the following html tag with a link :
> ```html
> <a href="https://www.scrap-me.com/"> Our Website </a>
> ```
> We can create the following rule :
> ```json
>    {
>        "htmlTag": "link",
>        "value": "Our Website",
>        "saveAs": "Company Link",
>        "saveType": "link"
>    }
> ```

#### html tags:

- class :
    > ```html
    > <div class="text container company">...</div>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` could here be `company` or `text`

    > ⚠️ Only __one__ class can be passed !
- id
    > ```html
    > <div id="company-name"> Company Name </div>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `company-name`
- tag
    > ```html
    > <h1> Company Name </h1>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `h1`

    > ⚠️ Only the __first corresponding tag__ will be saved !
- name
    > ```html
    > <input name="username" type="text" />
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `username`
- link
    > ```html
    > <a href="https://scrap-me.com/"> A Link </a>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `A Link`
- partialLink
    > ```html
    > <a href="https://scrap-me.com/"> A Link </a>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` could here be `link` or `A Li`
- css
    > 📖 a very flexible html tag selector :
    > ```html
    > <p> Welcome on </p><p> Scrap-Me </p><p> ! </p>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `p.content:nth-child(2)` to select the _Scrap-Me_
- xpath
    > 📖 the most flexible html tag selector :
    > ```html
    > <div class="informations">
    >     <img src="https://img.png" alt="logo" />
    >     <p> Company Name </p>
    > </div>
    > ```
    > the rule `value` will here be `//div[@class='name']/p`

#### saving types:

- string
    > to save any type of data
- link
    > to save link data from href tag


<br>

### ___c. The page basic rule___

By using `"/"` or `""` as the `urlSelector` you will create a __page basic rule__. 

This means that the following scrapping rule will apply to every page of the website. This will happen because every `url` has the `/` character in it. 

> ⚠️ This rule has to be __at the bottom end of the list of pages__ so it will be the last one to be applied if any other page matches the previous url selector.

You can use this selector so if some website doesn't use any specific string in the url for the page you want to scrap (if they use _random token_ or _user id string_), you can use it.
